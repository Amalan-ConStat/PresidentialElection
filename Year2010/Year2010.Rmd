# Structure of Document

Data extraction begins from page 2 of the document. There are two situations, 
one is where there are two tables in a page and other is where one table in a page.
Each cell has one value, which is votes or percentages depending on the column.

First Column is for Candidates names followed by Valid votes, Rejected votes and 
Total polled. Each district begins in a new page. It should be noted that the district
for respective electorates are not mentioned above any table or page.

# Validating Data extracted 

There is no summary for election results therefore only both way tallying
is compared between the extracted data.

## Checking for Registered Electors

So there is a printing error in the Kurunegala district Kuliyapitiya electorate table.
The final two rows should be Total polled followed by Regis Electors, but they have printed
Total Polled twice. Therefore the correct Total Registered Electors is 14088500.  

```{r Reg Electors}
# Extracting only Final District District Results of 
# Registered Electors
# and then adding all the votes 
ElecFinal2010<-subset(Election2010,Electorate=="Final District Result" 
                      & ColNames=="Regis Electors")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal2010[,sum(Votes),by="ColNames"]
# Extracting only Final District District Results of 
# Registered Electors
# and then adding all the votes
ElecFinal2010<-subset(Election2010,Electorate!="Final District Result"
                      & Electorate!="Postal District Votes" 
                      & Electorate!="Displace Votes"
                      & ColNames=="Regis Electors")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal2010[,sum(Votes),by="ColNames"]
```

![](Fig21.JPG)

So if we rename the second "Total Polled" as "Regis Electors" our problems 
will be resolved.

```{r Kurunegala Kuliyapitiya 1}
subset(Election2010,Electorate=="Kuliyapitiya" 
                    & District=="Kurunegala"
                    & ColNames=="Total Polled")
```

## Checking for Total Polled

So there is a printing error in the Kurunegala district Kuliyapitiya electorate table.
The final two rows should be Total polled followed by Regis Electors, but they have printed
Total Polled twice. Therefore the correct Total Polled value is 10596280.  

```{r Total Polled}
# Extracting only Final District District Results of 
# Total Polled
# and then adding all the votes 
ElecFinal2010<-subset(Election2010,Electorate=="Final District Result" 
                      & ColNames=="Total Polled")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal2010[,sum(Votes),by="ColNames"]

# Extracting except Final District District Results of

ElecFinal2010<-subset(Election2010,Electorate!="Final District Result" 
                      & ColNames=="Total Polled")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal2010[,sum(Votes),by="ColNames"]
```

So if we rename the second "Total Polled" as "Regis Electors" our problems 
will be resolved.
