================

# Structure of Document

Data extraction begins from page 2 of the document. There are two
situations, one is where there are two tables in a page and other is
where one table in a page. Each cell has one value, which is votes or
percentages depending on the column.

First Column is for Candidates names followed by Valid votes, Rejected
votes and Total polled. Each district begins in a new page. It should be
noted that the district for respective electorates are not mentioned
above any table or page.
