# Structure of Document

Data extraction begins from page 5 of the document. Each page from here has a 
table representing  each district. All tables follow the similar format. 

Each cell has two numeric values which are number of votes and percentages, this is 
true except for the first column. First column is for electorates, next is for registered
electors. After that we have 14 columns which are for political parties representing the 
candidates, followed by Valid Votes, Rejected Votes and finally Total polled.

# Process of Extraction

Each table has been extracted separately without any issues. Three inputs
are used the first is page number, second is number of rows rows in the table
(except heading). There is one special case which is for Gampaha district.
