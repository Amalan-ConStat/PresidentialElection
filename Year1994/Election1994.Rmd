# Structure of Document

Data extraction begins from page 4 of the document. Each page from here has a 
table representing  each district. All tables follow the similar format. 

If we consider the columns, first column is for candidate names with other counts,
second column and its consecutive columns are for electorates. Final two columns
are Postal Votes and Final District Results. 

Each cell has two numeric values which are number of votes and percentages, this is 
true except for the last row. First 6 rows are for candidates names, followed by 
No of Valid Votes, No of Rejected Votes, Total No of votes polled and finally
No of Registered Electors.

# Process of Extraction

Each table has been extracted separately without any issues. Two inputs are 
used, one is page number other is for special cases for several districts.

```{r Election 1994}
# load the pdf file
SL_PE_1994<-pdf_text("PresidentialElections1994.pdf")

# electorate name issues and scrapping them

## Comparing final tally votes of  Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe 

According to Electorates tally it should be 58888, but mistakenly
calculated as 58886. This occurs because of the Batticaloa District
Tally.

![](Fig4.JPG)

```{r Vaildating the data 6}
# Extracting only Final District District Results of 
# Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe 
# and then adding all the votes 
ElecFinal1994<-subset(Election1994,Electorate=="Final District Results" 
                      & ColNames=="Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal1994[,sum(Votes),by="ColNames"]

# Extracting except Final District District Results of 
# Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe 
# and then adding all the votes 
ElecFinal1994<-subset(Election1994,Electorate!="Final District Results" 
                      & ColNames=="Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal1994[,sum(Votes,na.rm = TRUE),by="ColNames"]
```

The real tally for Batticaloa district is 5030 but mis calculated
as 5028. So the Final Count for Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe is 58888.

### Batticaloa district

```{r Batticaloa District}
ElecFinal1994<-subset(Election1994,Electorate!="Final District Results"
                      & District=="Batticaloa"
                      & ColNames=="Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe")
ElecFinal1994[,sum(Votes,na.rm = TRUE),by="ColNames"]
```
