# Structure of Document

Data extraction begins from page four of the document. Each page from here has a 
table representing  each district. All tables follow the similar format. 

If we consider the columns, first column is for candidate names with other counts,
second column and its consecutive columns are for electorates. Final two columns
are Postal Votes and Final District Results. 

Each cell has two numeric values which are number of votes and percentages, this is 
true except for the last row. First 3 rows are for candidates names, followed by 
Total No of Valid Votes, Total No of Rejected Votes, Total No of votes polled and 
finally Total No of Registered Electors.

# Process of Extraction

Each table has been extracted separately without any issues. Two inputs are 
used, one is page number other is for special cases for several districts. 
Two functions were created to extract two types of tables, yet both of them
look similar except a few anomalies

```{r Election 1988}
# load the pdf file
SL_PE_1988<-pdf_text("PresidentialElections1988.pdf")

# source the function
source("Extract1988.R")

# creating initial dataset Election1994
Election1988<-NULL

# special pages which has the same format 
pages<-c(6,16,17,24)

for (i in pages) 
    {
    Election1988[[i]]<-Extract_Type1_1988(i)
    }

# final data set
Election1988<-do.call("rbind",Election1988)
```

# Validating Data Extracted

There is a summary for election results yet both way tallying
is compared between the extracted data. Also both way tallying is
used to clarify the summary as well. Both Way Tallying means summation of 
all district final results is equal to summation of all electorates final results.

## Checking for Registered Electors.

No issues here.

![](Fig2.JPG)

```{r Reg electors}
# Extracting only Final District Results of 
# Number of Registered Electors
# and then adding all the votes 
ElecFinal1988<-subset(Election1988,Electorate=="Total" 
                      & ColNames=="No of Registered Electors")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal1988[,sum(Votes,na.rm = TRUE),by="ColNames"]

# Extracting except Final District Results of 
# Number of Registered Electors
# and then adding all the votes 
ElecFinal1988<-subset(Election1988,Electorate!="Total" 
                      & ColNames=="No of Registered Electors")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal1988[,sum(Votes,na.rm = TRUE),by="ColNames"]
```

## Checking for Total Polled

54 votes are missing in the district summary table.

![](Fig2.JPG)

```{r Total Polled}
# Extracting only Final District Results of 
# Total Polled
# and then adding all the votes 
ElecFinal1988<-subset(Election1988,Electorate=="Total" 
                      & ColNames=="Total No of Votes Polled")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal1988[,sum(Votes,na.rm = TRUE),by="ColNames"]

# Extracting except Final District Results of 
# Total Polled
# and then adding all the votes 
ElecFinal1988<-subset(Election1988,Electorate!="Total" 
                      & ColNames=="Total No of Votes Polled")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal1988[,sum(Votes,na.rm = TRUE),by="ColNames"]
```

### Gampaha District

                      & ColNames=="No of Rejected Votes")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal1988[,sum(Votes,na.rm = TRUE),by="ColNames"]

# Extracting except Final District Results of 
# No of Rejected Votes
# and then adding all the votes 
ElecFinal1988<-subset(Election1988,Electorate!="Total" 
                      & ColNames=="No of Rejected Votes")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal1988[,sum(Votes,na.rm = TRUE),by="ColNames"]
```

## Checking for Valid Votes

Extra 3 votes added in the district tally table. Also it 
should be valid not valied.

![](Fig3.JPG)

```{r Total Valid}

# and then adding all the votes 
ElecFinal1988<-subset(Election1988,Electorate=="Total" 
                      & ColNames=="Total No of Valied Votes")
# added votes will be cross checked with the pdf document
ElecFinal1988[,sum(Votes,na.rm = TRUE),by="ColNames"]

# Extracting except Final District Results of 
# Total No of Valied Votes
# and then adding all the votes 
ElecFinal1988<-subset(Election1988,Electorate!="Total" 
                      & ColNames=="Total No of Valied Votes")
