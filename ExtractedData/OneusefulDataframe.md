# Useful Data-frame

There are three types of table information for votes and percentages.
Below are three tables explaining them clearly. It should be noted that
these are mock tables. Most of the issues occur with related to Postal
District Votes. In year 2005 there are lot of missing values that needs
to be calculated.

Each table is a mock representation of how an entire district results
can be represented with all the necessary information. In the tables Yes
means the value exists and No means the cell is empty.
